&lt;h1 id="jet-lag-and-the-logies"&gt;Jet Lag and the Logies&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="../../images/blueclock.png" style="width:3mm;height:3mm" /&gt;
On the weekend there was the Logies, after a three year absence due to
you-know-what, the virus that I refuse to mention out loud. The virus
whose name I dare not speak in case I summon it again.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Anyway, at the Logies there was a performance by Calum Scott, who had
flown out from the UK just before the Logies. And he delivered a
brilliant performance at the Logies, considering how jetlagged he would
have been, but in his own words he was “in the sky longer than he was on
the ground”.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://jetlagguy.com.au//posts/2022-06-23-jet-lag-the-logiesimages/Calum%20Scott.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Performing brilliantly, despite jet lag!&lt;br /&gt;
And that, folks, is a recipe for jet lag. Just ask Pamela Anderson.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For a really short business trip like this – and for Calum Scott,
this is a business trip – you wouldn’t bother adjusting your schedule
(Gordon et al. 2018). So no after parties for him, he’ll definitely be
ready for bed after performing. Pilots and cabin crew do exactly this,
which is why the cabin crew often ask you to shut your blinds while
flying – it’s not for your benefit, it’s for theirs.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now that we’re flying a bit more, it’s likely that people will be
doing short flights for long distances – like London for three days. If
you do a short trip for a few days, it’s probably worth staying in your
own time zone.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stay safe and happy (and safe!) travels&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Game of Zones</title>
      <dc:creator>Dr Steve Jasper</dc:creator>
      <link>https://jetlagguy.com.au/posts/2021-07-21-game-of-zones</link>
      <description>


&lt;p&gt;The 2̶0̶2̶0̶ 2021 Tokyo Olympics are almost upon us, in the most unusual
of times as the world is slowly emerging from the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being obsessed with jet lag means that I tend to view world events
through the lens of jet lag, and the Olympic Games is definitely no
exception. While there have been several models used to predict Olympic
medal success, none of them have taken jet lag into account as far as I
know. And while jet lag might only be a very small effect, remember that
the difference between taking home a gold medal versus a silver medal
can be measured in milliseconds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Happy H̶u̶n̶g̶e̶r̶ Olympic Games, and may the odds be ever in your
favour!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So I’m going to hopefully predict gold medals of leading nations (not
silver or bronze), taking jet lag into account. The Olympic Village will
only be open five days before the start of the games, and given the
Japanese public’s hostility to the Games, I can’t imagine a lot of
venues will be throwing their doors open to foreign athletes much ahead
of time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So let the games begin. But instead of a top five, I’m going to give
you:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;TWO TOP FIVES!&lt;/strong&gt; Taste that top 5 goodness, and accept
no substitutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="top-5-winners"&gt;TOP 5 WINNERS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;h2 id="japan"&gt;Japan&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not only does the Japanese team not have to deal with jet lag, but
they have the well-recognised host country advantage. Every country that
is the host has done extremely well when they host the Olympics, and I
expect Japan to be no exception. Team Japan should perform like it’s
1964, the last time they hosted the Olympics. But this is a brave
prediction, so here goes: &lt;gulp&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction for Japan:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gold-medals"&gt;15 gold medals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margin of error: ± 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="russia"&gt;Russia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While we tend to think of most Russians living in Europe, Vladivostok
is just off the coast of Japan, and there’s even a ferry directly to
Japan (when there’s not a pandemic, of course). It’s a simple matter for
the Russians to send their athletes to Siberia weeks in advance, have
them train in the same time zone as Japan, and completely avoid jet
lag.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction for Russia:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gold-medals-1"&gt;25 gold medals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margin of error: ± 3&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="south-korea"&gt;South Korea&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is a bit of a no-brainer, with South Korea just off the coast of
Japan. Back in 2012 a free Australian magazine mX called South Korea
“Nice Korea” and North Korea “Naughty Korea”, leading to a denunciation
from the [North] Korean Central News Agency, accusing the newspaper of
“bullying” them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction for South Korea:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gold-medals-2"&gt;14 gold medals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margin of error: ± 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That’s right, a free (and now defunct) Australian newspaper bullied a
nation of more than 20 million people. Our power is astonishing, we must
use it wisely. So I have nothing bad to say about either Korea, oh no
siree! Expect both Koreas to do well in the upcoming Olympics, and
here’s my prediction for Nice – oops, I mean South Korea:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="china"&gt;China&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A powerhouse of Olympic medal counts, and a nation more than capable
of going toe-to-toe against the US. Again, expect China to do well
because of the proximity to Japan, providing there are no more doping
scandals. Oops, did I say that out loud?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction for China:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gold-medals-3"&gt;40+ gold medals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margin of error: ± 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="australia"&gt;Australia&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Aussie! Aussie! Aussie! Oi! Oi! Oi!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We haven’t done so well at the last couple of Olympics, and when you
factor in jet lag it makes perfect sense. London is a very long way
away, not just in distance, but in time zones (10 hours!) – and Rio is
absolutely brutal, with an 11 hour time zone distance plus flying east,
which is harder. Tokyo by comparison will be easy for Australian
athletes, being one hour behind the east coast and one hour ahead of the
west coast. So look for that glint of gold coming home to Australia.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction for Australia:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gold-medals-4"&gt;15 gold medals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margin of error: ± 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h1 id="top-5-losers"&gt;TOP 5 LOSERS&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not all countries are going to be so fortunate, however. If there are
winners there are going to be losers, so here are a few countries that
are likely to not do as well as in previous games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="great-britain"&gt;Great Britain&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It’s a good 9 hour time zone difference (plus or minus an hour for
daylight savings), and the British have to fly east – a long way east.
For direction of flight, east is a beast, west is best (for most
people). So Team GB’s gold medal count might not be quite as much as in
previous years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction for Great Britain:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gold-medals-5"&gt;18 gold medals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margin of error: ± 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="france"&gt;France&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Likewise, another team flying a long way east, almost as far as the
British. We’re likely to see the French team not perform as well as in
previous games.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction for France:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gold-medals-6"&gt;7 gold medals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margin of error: ± 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="germany"&gt;Germany&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, flying a long way east will take the edge off performance
here, so expect a few less gold medals from the Germans.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction for Germany:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gold-medals-7"&gt;14 gold medals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margin of error: ± 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="italy"&gt;Italy&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the risk of sounding like I’m on repeat, flying east a long way.
The Italians have received 8 gold medals for the last couple of games,
but that might be one or two lower this time round.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction for Italy:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gold-medals-8"&gt;7 gold medals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margin of error: ± 1&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="usa"&gt;USA&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;USA! USA! Almost as good a chant as the Australian one. ;-)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other powerhouse. Unlike the European countries, the Americans
are flying west, which is generally not so bad. However, it is a long
way west, which is likely to take the edge off their performance.
Speaking of long flights, it reminds me of the time I was at San
Francisco Airport behind a plane load of people who had just arrived
from Tokyo, and a young woman ahead of me in the queue was wearing
leather pants. Because who wouldn’t want to wear leather pants on a 10
hour flight? Let’s hope Team USA don’t have leather pants as part of
their Olympic uniform, and have to wear them on the plane to Tokyo.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prediction for USA:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id="gold-medals-9"&gt;38 gold medals&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Margin of error: ± 4&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, will these numbers have any accuracy, or will COVID-19
completely shred them? Will I proudly point to this column like I’m the
Nostradamus of the Olympics, or will I quietly delete this and hope
nobody notices? Will I then be forced to assume a new identity like I’m
in the witness protection program? We’ll find out in a few weeks.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as always, h̶a̶p̶p̶y̶ ̶t̶r̶a̶v̶e̶l̶s̶ stay at home!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Top 5 Things I've Learned in Isolation</title>
      <dc:creator>Dr Steve Jasper</dc:creator>
      <link>https://jetlagguy.com.au/posts/2020-06-26-learned-in-isolation</link>
      <description>


&lt;p&gt;It’s been a while since I’ve done a top 5 here, so I’m overdue. As
for most people, the last few months have been a very different reality.
Here are my top 5 things I have learned in isolation:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number 5. Online shopping.&lt;/strong&gt; I just thought it was for
crap products you see being flogged on late night TV (“and now, the
AMAZING AbBlaster 3000!”). It wasn’t really a thing for me until… …
…shelving, hand sanitiser, a coffee table, a clothes rack, a desk,
chinos, teapots, picture frames, prints to go in those frames, another
coffee table, more shelving… I see delivery drivers more than anyone
else, and I plan my weeks around deliveries.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number 4. My home is immaculate.&lt;/strong&gt; Clean, tidy,
organised. A place for everything, and for everything a place. Including
shelving. I finally ran out of excuses not to tidy. Did I mention I’d
bought some furniture? I’m ready for the photo shoot in Vogue Living
now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No alt text provided for this image How my apartment looks.
Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number 3. Among the shopping: a yoga mat.&lt;/strong&gt; I then
received an email announcing a free online yoga class. I have also run
out of excuses in the yoga department. Downward-facing dog it is
then.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No alt text provided for this image Me in my non-existent apartment.
Almost.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number 2. My snack game is ON POINT.&lt;/strong&gt; A word of
explanation: I quit sugar at the end of last year (and promptly lost 9
kg, which explains my desire to stay off sugar). But cheese! Brie,
swiss, gouda, provolone. Cheese sticks. Seaweed snacks (in both sea salt
and sesame). Crystallised ginger (which I know contains some sugar, but
it’s ginger so I don’t eat lots). And nuts! Walnuts, cashews, and
abalone-flavoured macadamia nuts. And a variety of tea that you would
not believe. (Melon seed tea is a real thing, and contains neither
melons nor seeds.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Number 1. I can still run my business.&lt;/strong&gt; Obviously,
things are quiet on the jet lag front – the very few people who travel
internationally are less concerned about jet lag, and more concerned
about not contracting a potentially fatal disease. But there are things
happening quietly in the background while we regroup, and hopefully
develop a vaccine or treatment for coronavirus. You’ll be hearing some
exciting news soon!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And as always, happy travels staying at home!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flying to London, one city block at a time</title>
      <dc:creator>Dr Steve Jasper</dc:creator>
      <link>https://jetlagguy.com.au/posts/2020-01-17-flying-to-london</link>
      <description>


&lt;p&gt;Life after a PhD is different. Mainly in that I’m no longer chained
to a desk writing a thesis roughly the length of one of the longer Harry
Potter novels (one of J. K. Rowling’s lesser known works, Harry Potter
and the Jetlagged Executive).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’ve joined the gym, and I’m going every second day. I’ve taken
up eating healthy food (kale! carrots! seaweed!) and quit sugar (which
took some doing). I’ve committed to walking 10,000 steps a day, which is
apparently the bare minimum it requires to be healthy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To support me in this I downloaded the Qantas Wellbeing app, which
Qantas is using to reward healthy behaviour. I’ve committed to walking
10,000 steps a day, and when I do I get a “WOOHOO!” message on my screen
and 1.8 points per day. I’ve also committed to walking 80,000 steps a
week (because 70,000 is just too easy), and for that little feat I get 9
points per week doing 80,000 steps. My total points per week is (1.8 ×
7) + 9 = 21.6 points. My daily points come to 21.6 ÷ 7 = 3.09
points.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
At this point I need to issue a warning: The following LinkedIn article
contains mathematical calculations.
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To fly to London, return, on points it would cost me 183,900 points.
That’s a total distance of 16,893 km × 2 = 33,786 km. So, for every
point I earn, I get to travel 33,786 km ÷ 183,900 points = 0.184 km =
184 metres. (At least I could do that calculation in my head!) Multiply
that by the number of points I earn per day (3.09 points) and I get to
travel 567 metres towards my destination of London. Just over half a
kilometre per day, or two-and-a-half city blocks in downtown
Melbourne.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;aside&gt;
If you are traumatised from maths in school, please proceed with caution
and seek support from a health professional if required.
&lt;/aside&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Travelling at that rate, it will take me 183,900 points ÷ 3.09
points/day = 59597 days (let’s forget about the .2 repeater and assume
Qantas takes pity on me) which is 163 years, 2 months and half a day.
(Steve Hui, please feel free to check my maths and comment, you’re the
expert on frequent flyer points.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So, I’m probably not going to London just on points from walking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;BUT – the point isn’t the points! The point is that Qantas is
rewarding healthy behaviour (and I should totally get Frequent Flyer
points every time I eat kale). And I love the idea that every time I
walk to the beach in the evening, I get that little bit closer to my
next destination.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I like that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As always, happy travels!&lt;/p&gt;
