## To do

### Content

For Steve:

[ ] Add feature images to more pages
[ ] Convert raw links to posts, adding tags and some descriptive text
[ ] Decide on first or third person for text, and make it consistent

### Structure

For Peter:

[ ] Image resizing - only a problem for small inline images; use `{{< figure ... >}}` for larger images
[X] \<aside> not displaying
[X] MEQ redirect -> using a button instead
[X] favicon not showing
[X] left align section page text
[X] text width in section page

These two make it look more like an academic paper
