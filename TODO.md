## To do

### Content

For Steve:

* Add feature images to more pages
* Convert raw links to posts, adding tags and some descriptive text
* Decide on first or third person for text, and make it consistent

### Structure

For Peter:

* Image resizing - only for small inline images; use `{{< figure >}}` for larger images
* \<aside> not displaying
* ~~MEQ redirect~~ - using a button instead
* ~~favicon not showing~~
* ~~left align section page text~~
* ~~text width in section page~~

These two make it look more like an academic paper

* Content licensing: CC BY-ND 4.0
* How to cite instructions in page footer
