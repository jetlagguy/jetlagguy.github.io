We have two jet lag podcasts, because one podcast isn't enough!

For my interviews with thought leaders in the field of jet lag and circadian rhythm, see [**Jet Lag Interviews**](ejl-podcast), where I interview a thought leader in the realm of jet lag, circadian rhythm or sleep each week.

For my weekly round up what's happening in the world of jet lag, check out [**Jet Lag in the News**](whtbj-podcast), which comes out each Wednesday (Australian Eastern Time).
