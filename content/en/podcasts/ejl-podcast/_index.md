## Dr Matthew Weaver

{{< youtube id=w7zr_5TAJnw title="Dr Matthew Weaver" >}}

In this interview Dr Matthew Weaver discusses his research in shift work and its effect on the circadian rhythm, the benefit of rotating shifts forward instead of backwards, and some horrifying information about doctor's shifts in the hospital system.</br>

## Dr Marie-Pierre St-Onge

{{< youtube id=8YOWmUYxkt8 title="Dr Marie-Pierre St-Onge" >}}

Dr Marie-Pierre St-Onge tells us about her research into the circadian rhythm and food, telling us to be "inefficient" with our dietary intake to lose weight, and her new cookbook that helps us do exactly that.</br>

## Professor Leon Lack

{{< youtube id=Wp_523T5PiA title="Professor Leon Lack" >}}

I talk with Professor Lack about the development of the Re-Timer glasses, the importance of light management in maintaining a healthy circadian rhythm, including his work with the late Dr Michael Mosley and his sleep schedule.

## Dr Giorgio Varesco

I interview Dr Giorgio Varesco from the Université de Montréal regarding his work with speed skaters and how they have recovered from jet lag much more quickly than expected, which has implications for all of us. Also we discuss the challenges of monitoring athletes, and the increasing trend of athletic games such as baseball being played internationally.

## James Wilson

I talk with James Wilson about some useful supporting techniques for sleep, as well as quite a few useless techniques, such as red lights in the refrigerator, taping your mouth shut and waking up at 5 am. Having difficulty getting to sleep does not make you a "bad sleeper", and falling asleep right away does not make you a "good sleeper".

## Dr Jill McGarry

In this interview Dr Jill McGarry from Sleep Better Doctor (www.sleepbetterdoctor.co.uk) discusses her work with people who have sleeping disorders with a clinical psychology approach. We discuss the benefits of measuring light levels (and a simple way to do that!). There's also the US presidents flying on Airforce One, flying horses and bees around the world, a village in Norway that got no light during the winter, and why you get up to go to the bathroom to do a number 1, but never a number 2.

## Lynne Peeples

{{< youtube id=cLUjAGN9krg title="Lynne Peeples" >}}

In this interview Lynne Peeples talks about her initial fascination with coloured LED lights in a baseball locker room, early high school start times, the importance of medication timing. She lived in a bunker with no clocks and only dim red light for ten days, which broke her circadian rhythms. She also investigated sunflowers turning their heads in the middle of the night to maximise sunlight, and her trip to Alaska with virtually no night — all recounted in her book, "The Inner Clock".
