## Jet Lag and the Logies

![](images/blueclock.png){width="3mm" height="3mm"} On the weekend there was the Logies, after a three year absence due to you-know-what, the virus that I refuse to mention out loud. The virus whose name I dare not speak in case I summon it again.

Anyway, at the Logies there was a performance by Calum Scott, who had flown out from the UK just before the Logies. And he delivered a brilliant performance at the Logies, considering how jetlagged he would have been, but in his own words he was "in the sky longer than he was on the ground".

Performing brilliantly, despite jet lag!\
And that, folks, is a recipe for jet lag. Just ask Pamela Anderson.

For a really short business trip like this -- and for Calum Scott, this is a business trip -- you wouldn't bother adjusting your schedule (Gordon et al. 2018). So no after parties for him, he'll definitely be ready for bed after performing. Pilots and cabin crew do exactly this, which is why the cabin crew often ask you to shut your blinds while flying -- it's not for your benefit, it's for theirs.

Now that we're flying a bit more, it's likely that people will be doing short flights for long distances -- like London for three days. If you do a short trip for a few days, it's probably worth staying in your own time zone.

Stay safe and happy (and safe!) travels
