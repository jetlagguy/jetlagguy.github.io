## Keynote Topics

Dr Steve's keynotes are tailored to your specific audience and needs. The first step is a briefing call to clarify the precise problems and solutions that would be of most benefit to your organisation or audience. Each keynote tailors the following practical strategies from jet lag science to your group's specific needs:

### Prepare beforehand

You’ll know what you need to do to prepare yourself for a long-haul flight – what to eat, when to eat, when to sleep so that you’re ready to arrive refreshed and alert when you arrive at your destination! You’ll also learn the sneaky little trick to beating jet lag that airlines won’t tell you.

### Three Strategies

Learn the three things you need to know to minimise the impact of jet lag – three simple hacks that will transform your travel experience. You’ll learn my secret weapon that I used when I travelled to Paris that enabled me to present my work to an international audience.

### Returning home

After your long-haul flight, you want to return still performing at your peak, not falling in a heap. Learn the tactics you can use to not only manage yourself when you travel, but just as importantly, when you return home so that you’re not drained of energy, and you’re ready to participate in family, work and social life.
