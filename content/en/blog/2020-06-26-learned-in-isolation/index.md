It's been a while since I've done a top 5 here, so I'm overdue. As for most people, the last few months have been a very different reality. Here are my top 5 things I have learned in isolation:

**Number 5. Online shopping.** I just thought it was for crap products you see being flogged on late night TV ("and now, the AMAZING AbBlaster 3000!"). It wasn't really a thing for me until... ... ...shelving, hand sanitiser, a coffee table, a clothes rack, a desk, chinos, teapots, picture frames, prints to go in those frames, another coffee table, more shelving... I see delivery drivers more than anyone else, and I plan my weeks around deliveries.

**Number 4. My home is immaculate.** Clean, tidy, organised. A place for everything, and for everything a place. Including shelving. I finally ran out of excuses not to tidy. Did I mention I'd bought some furniture? I'm ready for the photo shoot in Vogue Living now.

How my apartment looks. Almost.

**Number 3. Among the shopping: a yoga mat.** I then received an email announcing a free online yoga class. I have also run out of excuses in the yoga department. Downward-facing dog it is then.

Me in my non-existent apartment. Almost.

**Number 2. My snack game is ON POINT.** A word of explanation: I quit sugar at the end of last year (and promptly lost 9 kg, which explains my desire to stay off sugar). But cheese! Brie, swiss, gouda, provolone. Cheese sticks. Seaweed snacks (in both sea salt and sesame). Crystallised ginger (which I know contains some sugar, but it's ginger so I don't eat lots). And nuts! Walnuts, cashews, and abalone-flavoured macadamia nuts. And a variety of tea that you would not believe. (Melon seed tea is a real thing, and contains neither melons nor seeds.)

**Number 1. I can still run my business.** Obviously, things are quiet on the jet lag front â€“ the very few people who travel internationally are less concerned about jet lag, and more concerned about not contracting a potentially fatal disease. But there are things happening quietly in the background while we regroup, and hopefully develop a vaccine or treatment for coronavirus. You'll be hearing some exciting news soon!
